# Phishing Email Analysis

## üìå Objective
The goal of this task is to analyze a suspicious email and identify phishing characterstics such as spoofed sender details,  fake links,  and social engineering tactics.

## üìß Sample Email Quick Summary
- **From:** `Support <support@msupdate.net>`  
- **Subject:** Microsoft account password change  
- **Headline:** Your password changed  
- **Account mentioned:** `ethan@hooksecurity.co`  
- **Security info shown:** Country/region: United States ¬∑ Platform: iOS ¬∑ Browser: Safari ¬∑ IP address: `77.196.86.10`  
- **Action links visible:** Reset your password ¬∑ Review your security info ¬∑ Learn how to make your account more secure ¬∑ opt out  
- **Signature:** The Microsoft account team

## üîç Analysis
**Sending domain mismatch**  
   - Email comes from `msupdate.net`. Official Microsoft security emails normally come from `microsoft.com`, `account.microsoft.com`, `microsoftonline.com`, or other   Microsoft-owned domains. `msupdate.net` is not an official Microsoft domain ‚Üí **suspicious**.

   **Brand impersonation**  
   - Styling and wording mimic Microsoft to build trust. Attackers commonly copy legitimate branding and then use a non-Microsoft sending domain.

   **Action links likely spoofed**  
   - Although link text looks legitimate, attackers often set the displayed text to a trusted URL while the actual href points elsewhere. Do **not** click; hover to inspect actual URLs or copy them (without opening) and scan.

    **Social-engineering pressure / plausible content**  
   - The email notifies about a password change and provides steps to recover ‚Äî a common phishing lure to get users to click and enter credentials.

   **Inclusion of IP & location**  
   - Listing an IP and location can increase perceived legitimacy. This can be faked or taken from a third-party; it is not by itself proof of legitimacy.

    **No raw headers shown**  
   - The screenshot does not include authentication headers (SPF / DKIM / DMARC). Without raw headers, we cannot confirm whether mail authentication passed.
**Preliminary verdict:** **Highly suspicious / likely phishing**. Final confirmation requires header analysis and safe URL/WHOIS checks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Immediate recommended actions (for the recipient)
**Do NOT click any link** in this email.  
- Open a browser and go directly to `https://account.microsoft.com` (type it yourself) to check recent sign-in activity.  
- If you suspect compromise: change your Microsoft password from the official site and enable MFA.  
- Report the message to Microsoft (for Office365: `phish@office365.microsoft.com`) or use your email provider‚Äôs ‚ÄúReport phishing‚Äù function.  
- If you accidentally entered credentials, change the password immediately and review other accounts that used the same password.

## ‚úÖ Technical Verification steps (what to collect and check safety)
**Save the raw headers** (`headers.txt`)  
   - In Gmail: *Show original* ‚Üí copy raw headers.  
   - Check `Authentication-Results:` for **SPF / DKIM / DMARC** (pass / fail). Note and explain results in `headers_analysis.md`.

**Inspect Received chain** (from bottom ‚Üí top)  
   - Find origin IP in the bottom-most `Received:` line. Compare origin host/IP to Microsoft‚Äôs known mail servers. Document findings in `headers_analysis.md`.

**Extract and check actual URLs** (do not open them)  
   - Hover to reveal hrefs or copy link targets as plain text. Scan those URLs on VirusTotal / URLhaus and save results as `url-analysis.md` and screenshots in `screenshots/`.

**WHOIS lookups**  
   - WHOIS for `msupdate.net` ‚Üí save as `whois_msupdate_net.txt`.  
   - WHOIS / IP lookup for `77.196.86.10` ‚Üí save as `whois_ip_77.196.86.10.txt`. Note registrar, creation date, and whether domain/IP belong to known Microsoft infrastructure.

**Reverse DNS / Mail server checks**  
   - Check whether the sending IP resolves to a Microsoft mail server or to a third-party hosting provider (document results).

**Archive evidence**  
   - Save screenshots: email body, header analyzer output, URL scan results. Place under `screenshots/`.

##  üìù Suggested Short Conclusion 
 **Verdict:** Likely phishing. The sending domain (`msupdate.net`) does not match Microsoft official domains; the message uses Microsoft branding and urges action via links. Without raw header authentication results, final confirmation is pending, but do not interact with the links ‚Äî verify via the official Microsoft site.
